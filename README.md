# getDDD

Download defined daily dose (DDD) information for selected ATC codes from the website of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Statistics Methodology (www.whocc.no).

This tool is intended as a convenience for academic and non-commercial users querying a relatively small number of ATC codes. Other users should consider purchasing the full catalogue of data, available here: https://www.whocc.no/atc_ddd_index_and_guidelines/order/.
